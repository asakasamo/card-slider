The width of the cards holder calculates to a value SLIGHTLY too small for the visible cards,
   and the nav appears slightly off-center as a result

Sometimes the very first click of the nav slides the cards SLIGHTLY too far left. I still have 
   no idea why it's doing that.

The navigation arrows aren't the right font. (Maybe they should be images...)

This isn't responsive - it's optimized for desktop.
